\section{Introduction}

In this vignette, we will introduce the \thispackage package, including its 
motivations and purpose, how to install it, its interface specifications, and a 
detailed 
example.


\subsection{Purpose}
This package is intended to serve somewhat the same purpose as the very 
(deservedly!) popular package \pkg{Rcpp}.  However, this package is not meant
to be a competitor to \pkg{Rcpp}.  Rather, it is meant to fill a very small niche
that \pkg{Rcpp} does not fill.


\subsection{License}

The \thispackage\ package is licensed under the very permissive 2-clause BSD 
license, commonly referred to as the FreeBSD license.  For a copy of the license,
see the file named \code{LICENSE} in the root directory of the package source.


\subsection{Installation}

The package should install without issue from the command line via the usual 
commands:
\begin{Command}
R CMD INSTALL SEXPtools_0.1-0.tar.gz
\end{Command}

Description: A set of C functions and macros that live on 
        top of R's native C interface. It can be used somewhat in the same way 
        as Rcpp, though it is much less comprehensive in scope than Rcpp. This 
        package is meant to help with the task of wrapping pure C (not C++) and
        Fortran code for use with R.  Currently, the package is very young; at
        this time, most of its utility is found in the print utilities, 
        simplified R object allocation (with automatic gc counting), and the 
        creation and management of lists and dataframes.  For instance, by 
        making use of C99's va_args, we can create arbitrary lists of named 
        objects in just 2 simple function calls.  For a full specification, see
        the package vignette.

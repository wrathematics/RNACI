Description: A set of C functions and macros that live on
    top of R's native C interface. It can be used somewhat in the same way
    as Rcpp, though it is much less comprehensive in scope than Rcpp. This
    package is meant to help with the task of wrapping pure C (not C++) and
    Fortran code for use with R.  Currently, the package is very young; at
    this time, most of its utility is found in the print utilities,
    simplified R object allocation (with automatic gc counting), and the
    creation and management of lists and dataframes.  For instance, by
    making use of C99's va_args, we can create arbitrary lists of named
    objects in just 2 simple function calls.  For a full specification, see
    the package vignette.

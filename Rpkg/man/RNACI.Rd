This package contains a set of hopefully useful functions and 
macros that live on top of R's native C interface. It can be used 
somewhat in the same way as Rcpp, though it is much less comprehensive 
in scope than Rcpp.

This package is meant to help with the task of 
wrapping pure C (not C++) and Fortran code for use with R using the 
native interface.  Currently, the package is very young.  At this time, 
most of its utility is found in the SEXP printer, simplified SEXP 
allocation (with automatic gc counting), and the creation and 
management of lists and dataframes.  For instance, by making use of 
C99's va_args, we can create arbitrary lists of named objects in just 2 
simple function calls.  For a full specification, see the package 
vignette.

This package is licensed under the permissive 2-clause BSD license.
